## Installing a code editor

To do these assignments, and follow the bootcamp along in the subsequent weeks, you will definitely need a code editor. Notepad is decent, but won't do the trick for the upcoming sessions.

There are many free code editors to download, such as VS Code, Sublime text, etc. We will be giving instructions to download and setup VS Code:

- Open a web browser and go to the VS Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click the "Download" button.
- Select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

You can also use online HTML editors like [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/html/online-compiler/) to complete the assignment.

Try to give more styling to the web page (bonus). Best of luck! :)

### Submission Instructions

* Work on a Git branch called `week1_<your_name>`.
* Create HTML files in the [`week_1`](./) folder itself.
* Add screenshots of the HTML files (when opened in a browser) to your PR description.
