# Week 5 - Views

Bootstrap was used to style the views of the Activity-tracker app and the Devise Views as well.

## List of Implemented Views & Features
* Styled the activities/stats page.
* Improved the design of authentication-related views: Log In, Sign Up and Reset   Password views
* Alerts and Notices have been styled using Bootstrap Alerts. 
* Light Mode has been added in addition and the modes can be toggled with a button on the navbar.
* A User Name field was added to Devise Models to record the name of the user. 
* Devise and Activities Models have been associated so that a particular user can view only their activities and stats.
