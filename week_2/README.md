# Week 2 - Ruby

To make you familar with ruby syntax, we have created some exercises to help you
learn and practice Ruby syntax - covering conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elsif`), 
different ways of iteration (`each`, `map`) and some object oriented code.

If you not familiar with programming concepts like `variable`, `function` and `class`,
you can refer to the following resources
- [TryRuby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) and
- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/).

> Pre-requisites - [Ruby is installed](https://github.com/IRIS-NITK/IRIS-RoR-Bootcamp-2022/tree/week2_assignment/setup).<br>

## Prime number

This is a simple assignment to familiarize ourself with ruby.
In this assignment we will learn about loops in ruby and a bit of
error handling.

A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a 
whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by 
any whole number other than itself and 1 
(e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
