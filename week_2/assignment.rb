# From an array A containing N integers, you construct a binary string S of length (N-1) as follows.
# -if A[i] > A[i+1],  S[i] = 1
# -if A[i] < A[i+1],  S[i] = 0

# Given the string S, determine the count of indices i,
# such that it is possible for A[i] to be the maximum element of the array A.
