# IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 2022-23

## [Essential Git](/essential_git.md)

## [Installation Guide](/setup)
We have provided three ways of setting up a development environment,
[Local Setup](/setup/local_setup.md), [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
and [Dev Container](/setup/dev_container.md). We recommend you to choose [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
if you face any issues while installing ruby [locally](/setup/local_setup.md).

> We recommend sticking to the versions mentioned in the Installation Guide and
> run commands exactly as instructed, as all assignments in this Bootcamp are
> tested with these versions.

## [Week 1 - HTML and CSS](/week_1)
In the first week, we will introduce you to basic concepts related to Web Development and Git.

## [Week 2 - Ruby](/week_2)
In this week, we'll take a look at Ruby and instructions to get your device ready for creating Ruby on Rails projects.

## [Week 3 - Getting Started with Rails and Model](/week_3)
In this we will learn how to install Ruby and Rails,
create a new Rails project and build a simple website.

Later we will take a closer look at Model of the MVC Architecture and talk about databases and working with records.

## [Week 4 - Controllers and Authentication](/week_4)

This week, we will look into controllers, routing and authentication.

## [Week 5 - Views](/week_5)

So after 4 weeks, we have our basic app ready! ðŸ¥³
However, there is one problem. It looks ðŸ¥´. Lets fix that! We'll now style our application using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and look at the _View_ layer which is responsible for presenting data appropriately.

## [Week 6 - Associations & Validations](/week_6)
We have so far learnt a LOT of stuff. Starting right from ruby, to models, controllers, views, we have come so far. Yet there are many concepts that are still to be discussed, two of the most important being *Associations* and *Validations*
