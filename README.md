# IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 2022-23

## [Essential Git](/essential_git.md)

## [Installation Guide](/setup)
We have provided three ways of setting up a development environment,
[Local Setup](/setup/local_setup.md), [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
and [Dev Container](/setup/dev_container.md). We recommend you to choose [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
if you face any issues while installing ruby [locally](/setup/local_setup.md).

> We recommend sticking to the versions mentioned in the Installation Guide and 
> run commands exactly as instructed, as all assignments in this Bootcamp are 
> tested with these versions.

create a new Rails project and build a simple website.
