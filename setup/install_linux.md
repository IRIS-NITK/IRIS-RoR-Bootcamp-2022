# Installing Ubuntu

If you are using Windows, we recommend you to install and use the LTS version of Ubuntu (or) any other Linux distro of your choice.
There are multiple ways of installing a Linux distro:
- Dual Boot
- Virtual Machine
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Dual Boot

_Dual booting_ installs multiple operating systems - in this case, Windows and Ubuntu (or any other Linux distro). 
Every time you power on your device, you can decide
the operating system you want to use.

We recommend this option only if you are comfortable in performing this operation, since this could have possible repercussions.
You can do either of the following:
- Refer to the article: [How To Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows in Dual-Boot](https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-alongside-with-windows-dual-boot/)
- Refer to the YouTube video: [Dual-Boot Ubuntu Aloginside Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5QyjHIYwTQ)

## Virtual Machine

If dual booting is not possible, consider installing Ubuntu or any other Linux distro on a virtual machine.
By using a Virtual Machine, you can run Ubuntu or any other Linux distro within Windows like any
other application.

> Using a Virtual Machine can be slow, especially if you allocate less
> than 4 GB RAM. Try dual-booting in such cases.
- You can install Virtual box and Ubuntu by following this tutorial: [Install Ubuntu on Virtual Box](https://itsfoss.com/install-virtualbox-ubuntu/)
- You can also install VMWare Workstation(not _Workstation Pro_, since its a paid software) and Ubuntu by following this tutorial: [Install Ubuntu on VMWare Workstation](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_vmware_workstation/)

## WSL
You can very easily install Linux distros by following the installation documentation of WSL: [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
