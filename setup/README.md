# Installation

One of the following ways can used to install a Ruby and RoR
- [Dev Container](./dev_container.md)
- [GitHub codespaces](./github_codespaces.md)


**Note** - If you are unable to install Ruby due to some reason, you can still
participate in bootcamp with the help of [GitHub codespaces](./github_codespaces).
